The ultimate laggy 4X game. The farther your units are from your cities, the slower they are to respond to your commands!

#Controls
Left click to select a unit. Right click to order the unit to move/attack an in-game tile. Right click and drag to move the map around. Use scrolling to change zoom level of the map. 


N is a hotkey for next turn. If you hold down shift, you will be able to queue orders; if you aren't holding shift while you give an order, it will count as an override ("set") order, which deletes all prior orders.

#Commentary
The AI I've written seems insanely strong at first glance. I've just played the first three matches, and I got absolutely trashed by the AI.

VERY unbalanced with respect to food right now. Food is basically useless, except for building new cities. The AI is basically swamped in food negatives despite building a ton of farms, so the first few cities that it builds with the 1k really count.


### Direct download (jar file)
See releases section.

## Bugs
Please report all bugs. There are a ton of bugs, especially with map vision (selecting enemy units and such is kind of broken when they're dead or moved away, or similar).

## In progress
- Making the UI not a complete hack (if you have any advice, it would be very appreciated)
- Multiplayer
- Better AI
- More balance and more content (tech, etc.)

Suggestions are appreciated.
